# 1.6  
###Description:  
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. If the compressed string would not be smaller than the original string, then return the original.  

###Assumptions:  
- string has only upper and lowercase letters a-z  

###Example:  
- aabcccccaaa -> a2b1c5a3  

###Improvements:  
- leave single letters as is, i.e. aabcccccaaa -> a2bc5a3
