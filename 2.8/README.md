### Description:  
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop. Circular linked list: A corrupt linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.  

### Assumptions:  
- uses LinkedList class so data in each node is a single int.  

### Example:  
```
Input: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 2 (same 2 as earlier)
Output: 2
```
