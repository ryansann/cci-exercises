### Description:  
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop. Circular linked list: A corrupt linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.  

### Assumptions:  
- uses LinkedList class so data in each node is a single int.  

### Example:  
```
Input: A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> C (same C as earlier)
Output: C
```
