# 2.7  
### Description:  
Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on refernce not value. That is if the kth node of the first linked list is exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.  

### Assumptions:  
- uses LinkedList class so data in each node is a single int.  
- returns first node where intersection is detected (could be more).  

### Example:  
- see main.cpp
