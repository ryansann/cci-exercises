# 2.5  
### Description:  
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's place is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. 

### Assumptions:  
- uses LinkedList class so data in each node is a single int.  

### Example:   
```
Input: 7 -> 1 -> 6, 5 -> 9 -> 2 (617, 295)
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9 (912)
```
